# Who am I?
I am Jonathan, currently a high school student with focus on visual arts. My interest with programming started, when I wanted a faster computer and my dad installed Linux for me (I was 10 ðŸ˜…). I didn't like most of the software on Linux (I love beautiful UIs) and wanted to start creating apps myself. I got into webdesign in 2019 and started developing Flutter applications in 2020. It is almost 2022 and I am comfortable using Flutter, even if I still learn a lot with every project. I am currently looking at NodeJS for backends and React.js for frontends, more specifically SSR React.JS based frameworks. 

# My Plans
![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)
![Postgres](https://img.shields.io/badge/postgres-%23316192.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)

Even though I am currently learning Dart / Flutter, I want to started learning JavaScript, specifically NodeJS and React.js.
| Planned     | Currently learning  | Comfortable using |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Remix       | PostgreSQL          | Flutter           |
| Hydrogen    | React.js            | Next.JS           |

I know that this table currently looks a bit sad and depressing, but I don't worry too much about it. I don't know what comes tomorrow: maybe I lose my interest in Kotlin KMM or React.js, I don't know. ðŸ˜‰
