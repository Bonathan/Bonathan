## My Plans
Even though I am currently learning Dart / Flutter, I want to start learning NodeJS and Kotlin.
### Server
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)
![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)
![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/express.js-%23404d59.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=express&logoColor=%2361DAFB)

Since I already took a look at Flutter, so front-end development, my focus shifted to backend development and databases. I am learning NodeJS and Express.js to create serverside JavaScript applications. Since everyone is using Express.js I take a look at it as well.
### Database / SQL
![Postgres](https://img.shields.io/badge/postgres-%23316192.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)

After having looked at SQL and having tried out Postgres on Supabase I settled on using Postgres. There is no specific reason, it's just what I used in the beginning.

### Flutter
![Dart](https://img.shields.io/badge/dart-%230175C2.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=dart&logoColor=white)

I've chosen Flutter as front-end because I dislike HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the Browser. With Flutter I only have to write Dart, which I really enjoy.
