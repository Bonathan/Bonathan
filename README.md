# Who am I?
I'm Jonathan, @Jouhney , and I am learning Flutter to try to get into programming. I hope that by publishing my code on GitHub,
I stay motivated enough to keep on coding. We'll see how that goes.

## My Plans
Even though I am currently learning Dart / Flutter, I want to start learning some other, modern languages. I am interested in Go and Python, specifically FastAPI.
* Python w/ FastAPI
* Go

I am working on my first big project, [Time Hub](https://github.com/Jouhney/timehub#readme). It should become a drop-in replacement for the Google Nest Hub, and is under heavy development.
